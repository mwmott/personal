I"<p>For our first website in my Interaction Design class at Columbia, we were tasked with building a simple travel website. I’ve always had a fascination for mountains and books, so I thought, “why not combine them?”</p>

<p>The result was “Climb and Write”, a site which explores the connections between authors and the mountains they climbed.</p>
