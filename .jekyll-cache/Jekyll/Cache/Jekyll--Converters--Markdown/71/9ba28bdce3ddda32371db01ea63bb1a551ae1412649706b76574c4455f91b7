I"Â<p>It was an early, cool morning in the Bronx when I got the email from Professor Padwe. He was asking for photos for a story of mine which had been due the night before.</p>

<p>â€œGet those pictures of the judges,â€ he said. Today.</p>

<p>I freaked. Calling the clerks Iâ€™d become friendly with immediately at the Bronx County Supreme Court, I begged to let me come take a picture or two. They said theyâ€™d try to help.</p>

<p>With an out-of-battery camera and no charger, I ran â€” literally, ranÂ â€” to Harlem to find one. After lacing up my running shoes and speeding up Amsterdam and Morningside Park, I eventually found a unit. I had only a few hours sleep the night before â€” but it was just one of those days.</p>

<p>I got the photos. After getting a call from Monique and Beth on my way to Harlem, I learned the judges could do it in an hour. The short story is I charged my camera at home, ran to 125th and St. Nick Ave. to grab the B train and got the shots. The judges were kind; I promised I would send them my piece once it was all done.</p>

<p>To any journalism students reading this, Iâ€™m sure this might sound familiar. If our years have been anything alike, youâ€™ve seen last-minute calls and deadline moments, most saved largely by the generosity of others and our instinct to go that last, necessary step.</p>

<p>But we did it. Despite all the sleepless nights, frantic emailing, desperate calls like the above, we did it. To all the journalism students reading, congratulations, sincerely. You made the deadlines, wrote the words, spoke with strangers. You convinced people to take time out of their New York lives to talk to you. One word Iâ€™d like to describe what Iâ€™m most proud of all you: your hustle. You inspired me.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re reading this and arenâ€™t in the j-school community, hereâ€™s a few things our class can be proud of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When a gas explosion caused a building collapse in Harlem, my classmates went to the scene and did stories.</li>
	<li>indian</li>
	<li>Some of the best photographers I've ever seen did out in the cold</li>
	<li>women in journalism</li>
	<li>free aj staff</li>
	<li>My interaction design class did some of my favorite online projects, ever.</li>
	<li>See plenty more of our work curated on <a href="http://www.columbiajournalist.org/">The Columbia Journalist</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s that determination, damnit that youâ€™re going to get that one last piece for the story, whether itâ€™s a source, shot, code for your data project or something else. Itâ€™s that dedication â€” not the new ventures like Vox or FiveThirtyEight â€” that gives me hope for the future of journalism.</p>

<p>And I couldnâ€™t be prouder to be here together with you. At a time when most are running like hell away from journalism like it was a burning building, we decided to run in. Because thatâ€™s what journalists do. Iâ€™ve been honored to call you classmates, and now, colleagues.</p>

<p>And thank God we did. Like any other time, our society needs journalism, and I suspect, now more than ever. Wars are going on, politicians have power and corporations influence the lives of people everyday. As a profession, we have a responsibility to give people the information they need to self-govern. To protect democracy.</p>

<p>And thereâ€™s a lot of new possibilities to do that. The potential opened up by the web, tech and data gives us the opportunity to do journalism that serves the purpose of democracy better than ever, and to think of new ways to do it. Journalismâ€™s first loyalty is to citizens, and we have to figure out how to get people reading, and to keep them doing so. Whichever country you come from, your readers need us to think innovatively, if weâ€™re to do our job right.</p>

<p>For those who are still interested in data and the intersection of tech and journalism: You can still learn. My biggest lesson in that area has been more reminder than anything: We can teach ourselves these things. And after meeting with the good nerds at ProPublica, WNYC, NICAR and The New York Times, Iâ€™ve found thatâ€™s how theyâ€™re doing it too. Itâ€™s just means becoming better Googlers, and being patient with yourself as you learn. Besides, journalists are the best self-teachers â€” you do it every damn story. The best advice I got was to find something you wanted to know, and then learn the tech to do it. And of course, ask for help, probably before you need it. Weâ€™re all in this together.</p>

<p>I came to j-school because I wanted to get the best education in journalism I could get. With the industry changing, I thought the traditional path of a grizzled editor teaching cub reporters would be difficult to find, and so decided to come to Columbia. I wasnâ€™t disappointed. I thought it was a mixed bag coming here right after undergrad â€”Â but now I couldnâ€™t be happier I did. For the last year, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of being around some of the most dedicated, intelligent and caring people Iâ€™ve ever met. I was surrounded by better reporters and journalists overall than me, whether students, professors or visitors to our school, and I consider myself extremely lucky to have had this. Now I know where to strive to, and whom I have the honor of doing it with.</p>

<p>We are forerunners for the next generation of journalism. And I couldnâ€™t be prouder to be here in it with you, Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Class of 2014.</p>

<p>â€“</p>

<p>And thatâ€™s what gives me hope. The fact that so many of us â€” and many other j-school grads as well â€” came here and decided it was worth our time, money, hearts and souls â€” that tells me that this profession has a future. Nothing can fail with so much heart and soul.<br />
All my love, and good luck out there.</p>

<p>Mike</p>
