<p>Our data class (taught by the wonderful <a href="http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~cocteau/">Mark Hansen</a>) at Columbia’s School of Journalism was given an opportunity last November reporters traditionally haven’t: “Find something interesting in this data.”</p>

<p>Diving into the Sunlight Foundation’s <a href="http://capitolwords.org/api/1/">Capitol Words API</a>, we started looking at all words spoken on the floor of the U.S. Congress since 1996. With drones trending after recent bombing in the middle east, we searched in R how often the word was said. We wondered if we could use that as a milestick for the conversation around drone warfare.</p>

<p>First step was to examine the data. We checked the head and tails of the data to get a sense of what we were looking at, after we pulled the word drone going back to 1996 on the API (warning for the faint of heart: What follows is a bunch of R code):</p>

<pre>
   sll_cw_timeseries("drone",key="b1884b38a7e04ffeb9bdc91a0a63fe1b")
</pre>

<p>Then plotted it simply:</p>

<pre>
plot(dronets$day,dronets$count)
</pre>

<p><img src="/assets/img/post/drone1.png" alt="Drone sketch" /></p>

<p>From this rough sketch we saw there was a major outlier: the spike on the y-axis.</p>

<pre>
	# ggplot of word 'drone' over time, sorted by party.
	install.packages(ggplot2)
	library(ggplot2)
	dat_d &lt;- sll_cw_timeseries(phrase='drones', party="D", 
														 key = "6a0998f8ba3c4a8b888ef28b20975174")
	dat_d$party &lt;- rep("D", nrow(dat_d))
	dat_r &lt;- sll_cw_timeseries(phrase='drones', party="R", 
														 key = "6a0998f8ba3c4a8b888ef28b20975174")
	dat_r$party &lt;- rep("R", nrow(dat_r))
	dat_both &lt;- rbind(dat_d, dat_r)
	ggplot(dat_both, aes(day, count, colour=party)) + geom_line() +
	theme_grey(base_size=20) + scale_colour_manual(values=c("blue","red"))
</pre>

<p>Breaking this down by party showed the general trend of the word’s usage between parties.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/post/drone2.png" alt="Drone finish" /></p>

<p>As we can see, the largest usage was Rand Paul’s 235 repetitions during his filibuster in mid-March of last year.</p>

<p>Does this get us any closer to figuring out the formula for the national conversation? Maybe not. <a href="https://twitter.com/tjl">Tom Lee</a>, the director of Sunlight Labs, advised us to as always be careful in drawing conclusions. Correlation, not causation.</p>

<p>But we did find a story, and I’m sure this dataset will be useful in the future.</p>
