I"Ü<p>As I return from a mini-trip through Southern California (visiting <em>The LA Timesâ€™</em> Data Desk and the California Central Coast), I turn to whatâ€™s next. In several weeks, I will be starting out as a general assignment reporter in Mendocino County, north of San Francisco, in the little town of Willits, CA. What will come next? Will I be able to keep up my work in data journalism while doing the work of a regular reporter? This is what Iâ€™m thinking about.</p>
