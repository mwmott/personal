I"Ñ<p>At the close of my internship at <em>The Seattle Times</em>, I made <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localpages/2024591614_preschool-enrollment-changes.html">this</a> interactive map to complement an <a href="http://blogs.seattletimes.com/educationlab/">Education Lab</a> series on state-funded pre-k education.</p>

<p>It shows how state-funded pre-kindergarten enrollment has changed over the last ten years. This project taught me a lot about jQuery and Javascript, along with learning how to create a CSV that the slider can ‚Äúread‚Äù. Many thanks to Thomas Wilburn, a fellow news nerd, for his help on this project.</p>

<p><b>To use this map:</b> Hover for state-level enrollment data and move the slider to see changes through the years. You can see success stories by looking at how the states without programs (like FL) grow in color intensity.</p>
