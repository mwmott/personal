I" <p>As I return from a mini-trip through Southern California (visiting <em>The LA Times’</em> Data Desk and the California Central Coast), I turn to what’s next. In several weeks, I will be starting out as a general assignment reporter in Mendocino County, north of San Francisco, in the little town of Willits, CA. What will come next? Will I be able to keep up my work in data journalism while doing the work of a regular reporter? This is what I’m thinking about.</p>

<p>In some sense, I think this is just right: Many say data journalism should be part of what it means to be a journalist today — just one more step in the fluency of today’s media. I’m looking forward to covering a small beat, and I’m just as curious about the town as I am about how I might bring a familiarity with data to the job.</p>

<p>The traditional path for journalists was, I’ve been told, started out at a small-town paper. Generally, if succesful that would lead to a mid-size paper, to a regional, to a national and beyond. I doubt the path is as solid (or if it ever was), but it feels right to go somewhere smaller for a bit.</p>

<p>There’s big news, too: A bypass will be installed in several months in the town of Willits, it’s drought-central, and the town has shifted from heavy lumber to pot.</p>

<p>My one concern is finding time to program. But this too seems like a test — if not surrounded by data, news apps and the like, can I bring it? I think so. But this will be a good time to prove it, most of all to myself.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
