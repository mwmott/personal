<p><em>This piece is one in a series about the Pelham Bay Landfill Case, a 22-year Bronx case that settled in July of 2013. My classmates and I at Columbiaâ€™s School of Journalism covered the landmark case from a variety of perspectives. I took the judges.</em></p>

<p><strong>It wasnâ€™t easy presiding over the Pelham Bay case.</strong></p>

<p>Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months and months turned into years, twenty-two of them before a trial date was set. Now it was July of 2013 at the Bronx County Supreme Court, and with a month left before the Pelham Bay Landfill case would be tried, the lawyers and Bronx Judge Larry Schachner were struggling to reach a settlement.</p>

<p>â€œThere was no guarantee that, if we went to trial, we were going to win,â€ said Mitchel Ashley, one of the plaintiffsâ€™ attorneys. â€œAnd on the city-side, there was no guarantee that we werenâ€™t going to win.â€</p>

<p>A 14-year veteran of New Yorkâ€™s civil, housing and criminal courts, Schachner, 53, suggested the idea for a settlement in January of 2013. He was determined to bring a settlement about; if one wasnâ€™t reached, given the caseâ€™s long and complicated nature Nonnon v. City of New York could be in the courts for years to see him. As the trial date neared, he continued asking lawyers from both sides to come in. Through his initiative, lawyers for the city and the 11 plaintiffs began to meet almost daily, after only meeting monthly earlier.</p>

<p>In an interview in December of 2013, Schachner recalled the settlement negotiations. Wearing a business suit in his quiet, unadorned robing room, he spoke of the final weeks.</p>

<p>â€œIt was in this courtroom right here,â€ Schachner said, pointing to room 707 where he moved back and forth between the parties. Beneath the brass chandeliers, heâ€™d speak with one side, then with the other in his robing room. Then, they would come together. â€œSitting at the table altogether, I try to find a middle ground,â€ Schachner said. â€œAt times [each sideâ€™s lawyers] dug their heels in. When they did that, I said, â€˜Come back tomorrow.â€™â€</p>

<hr />

<p>Sitting at the head of a wooden conference table in his Bronx Courthouse chambers, Chief Administrative Judge Douglas McKeon, 65, remembered the beginning of the case. Clerks buzzed around red leather furniture for his signature, and law books adorned the mahogany shelves. He wore blue suspenders, a gold collar pin and two cellphones strapped to his waist.</p>

<p>â€œThis wasnâ€™t any ordinary case,â€ he said, referring to the scientific complications that came with it. The case came to McKeon on January 15, 1991 when Patricia Nonnon, the mother of the late Kerri Nonnon, filed a civil suit against the city claiming that toxins dumped in the landfill may have caused her daughterâ€™s leukemia and eventual death.</p>

<p>With his prior experience in malpractice cases, McKeon said he had seen similar cases based on causation before. He said, however, the science involved in the Pelham Bay case brought many new issues.</p>

<p>â€œEpidemiology, causation â€¦ these were areas that were growing at the time,â€ McKeon said. â€œWhy has someone become sick? We deal with it in medical malpractice â€¦ [but] there was a suspicion over the scientific assistance that wasnâ€™t what it is today.â€</p>

<p>McKeon added that he had no idea the case would last 22 years. He saw his role in the beginning to give the case due process, and to make sure the families charging the city knew that.</p>

<p>â€œI remembered Bert Blitz [one of the plaintiffâ€™s lawyers] asking if Nonnon and the others could sit in [on few conferences at the beginning], and of course we allowed that,â€ McKeon said. â€œMy purpose was to be more reassuring that the process was going to be a full and complete one, and whatever the outcome, these families would feel their loved ones were given good treatment. There has to be a humanity that courts show, not just in outcome, but in treatment.â€</p>

<hr />

<p>Motions and appeals about causation, science and legal procedures occupied attorneys and judges for years. Judges Stanley Green, Betty Stinson, Alexander Hunter, Jr., Paul Victor and Janice Bowman presided over the case after McKeon, and other judges presided after the city appealed it twice. Mitchel Ashley said with the appellate process, cases take time.</p>

<p>Schachner said the issue of deciding whether the science was valid was a complicated issue for the judges. â€œA scientist is going to look at things differently than from judges and lawyers â€” we arenâ€™t scientists,â€ he said. â€œSometimes the courts are called on to determine whether the expert can prove what he wants to prove.â€</p>

<p>The city continued to argue that it would be impossible to prove the link between toxic dumping and leukemia at the landfill. And two of the judges agreed. After the caseâ€™s first appeal was rejected in a 3-2 decision, Judge Richard T. Andrias wrote a dissenting opinion which questioned the science, calling it â€œfuzzy science at its worst,â€ court documents show.</p>

<p>Ashley said the difficulty involved in proving or disproving whether the landfill had caused illness and death was a major factor in the push for a settlement. â€œUltimately the clients felt that enough was enough, and that they would take the settlement,â€ Ashley said.</p>

<hr />

<p>Schachner said the plaintiffs in the case originally asked the city for $50 million, and the city countered with a $3 million offer.</p>

<p>â€œA gap like that didnâ€™t close right away,â€ he said. â€œIt didnâ€™t happen in one or two sessions. And once we got closer, I think the parties realized an agreement was possible.â€</p>

<p>The cityâ€™s side was now in the hands of the cityâ€™s negotiating team, a group that was separate from the litigation team that had been involved in the case from the beginning. The negotiation team was much more eager to settle the case than the litigators, Ashley said. After receiving the cityâ€™s initial offer, Ashley said he and the other plaintiff lawyers refused, and waited for another three and a half hours until the city made another offer. When it was only a half a million more, Ashley said, they left.</p>

<p>The city had offered small amounts for a settlement before, Ashley said, but now was gradually offering amounts that were becoming more agreeable to the plaintiffs. â€œWe came back the next time and they came up to five mil,â€ Ashley said. â€œAnd so it went back and forth like that for awhile.â€
Ashley said at first, he didnâ€™t think the city would offer enough for a settlement though. â€œIt was the same old stuff we had been dealing with for years, where the city would say they really wanted to settle the case but would make offers that would obviously never be able to settle [it].â€</p>

<p>Ashley said it was Schachnerâ€™s ability to get both sides to trust him that led to the settlement. During the negotiations, Schachner and Ashley said the city and plaintiffâ€™s lawyers met initially, then would separate, and Schachner would send one side out while he worked with the other.</p>

<p>â€œThe plaintiffsâ€™ lawyers sat in one part of the courtroom, and the defendantsâ€™ sat in the judgeâ€™s robing room, and he shuttled back and forth â€” shuttle diplomacy,â€ Ashley said. â€œSchachner really helped push it along. He kept saying, â€˜No, no, come back. Weâ€™ll talk more, weâ€™ll get the right people here.â€™ I think that he is the main reason the case got settled.â€</p>

<hr />

<p>On July 29, an agreement was finally reached: $12 million.</p>

<p>â€œWe were all in the courthouse together when we got to a number,â€ Ashley said. â€œWe said we would take that number back to our clients just to confirm it, but that as far as we were concerned, the case was settled.â€</p>

<p>Schachner remembered the feeling when the sides agreed. â€œWe were maybe a little emotionally drained,â€ Schachner said, after the case was closed. â€œBut I think all sides were happy a fair settlement had come about.â€</p>

<p>As to whether this case would influence a similar case regarding toxic dumping on Staten Island, Schachner said it wasnâ€™t likely. He said however that a standard may have been set regarding some of the motions at the appellate level, and McKeon said the case could be referred to when dealing with compensation over exposure to chemicals.</p>

<p>Back in his robing room, Schachner looked back on the case and said, â€œItâ€™s a tragedy for all these families, but I had to put my sympathies aside to be fair about this case. I have so many cases that I canâ€™t really dwell â€” Iâ€™m moving on to other cases. After 14 years though, it was one of the more memorable ones.â€</p>
