I"]<p>Whether youâ€™re on Wall Street or (my favorite) Mott Street, every block tells a story. For our second assignment in Interaction Design, I decided to tell a story of my block: West 114th, between Broadway and Amsterdam.</p>

<p>The result was the following site, which explains the movie sets which often pop-up, the everyday wildlife of the block and the strange fraternities that share the space with everyone else who walks this street.</p>
