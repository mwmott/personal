I"ç<p>In data wizard Mark Hansenâ€™s class, our first project was an assignment: Sarah Cohen from the The New York Times wanted us to look at the NYT API to find a story.</p>

<p>We decided to look into drones and when top legislators in drone policy visited The White House.</p>

<p>This was our progression:</p>
