I"û<p>When my internship started at <em>The Seattle Times</em>, I was able to meet various reporters to see if a data-angle might be possible on any ongoing projects. It was in this way I met <a href="https://twitter.com/katherinelong">Katherine Long</a>, a fantastic higher-education reporter who was looking into the differences in financial aid between for-profit, public and private schools.</p>

<p>With help from <a href="http://thomaswilburn.net/">Thomas Wilburn</a>, I made this interactive chart to accompany Katherineâ€™s <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2023980122_careercollegesxml.html">story</a> on the subject. Using <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, it allowed readers to sort schools by institution type and other factors to see which had the breakdown on student-default rates and types of aid.</p>

<p>I owe a lot to Thomas for helping me with this, as my first project at <em>The Seattle Times</em>. <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localpages/2023892102_ceo-pay-2014.html">His</a> chart was a great reference.</p>
