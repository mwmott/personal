It was an early, cool morning in the Bronx when I got the email from my professor, Sandy (don't you dare call him that) Padwe. My piece on the 22-year old court case with an angle from the judge's perspective had been due the night before. But, I needed photos. Could you get them today?

Of course, I said. I freaked. I called the clerks and administrative aides I'd become friendly with at the Bronx County Supreme Court from my bedroom in Morningside Heights and begged them to let me come take the judges' picture. They'd try to help, they said, and would get back to me.

With a camera out of battery and no charger — murphy's law — I decided to run to Harlem to find something. I put on my running shoes and sped up Amsterdam, jumped down Morningside Park and found a working unit. I'd only had a few hours sleep with my third revision to Padwe the night before — it was just one of those days.

Of course, I got the photos, after getting a call from Monique and Beth on my way to Harlem that the judges could do it in an hour. Charged my camera at home for what little time I had and ran back to 125th and Saint Nicholas Ave. to grab the B train. The judges were kind, and I promised after taking their photos tha tI would send them my piece.

To the journalism students reading this, I'm sure some of this might sound familiar. If our years have anything alike, you've seen last-minute calls, deadline moments saved largely by the generosity of others and our instinct to go that last, extremely necessary step.

But we did it. Despite all the sleepless nights, frantic emailing, desperate calls like the above, we did it. To all the journalism students reading, congratulations, sincerely. You made the deadlines, wrote the words, spoke with strangers. You convinced people to take time out of their New York lives to talk to you. One word I'd like to describe what I'm most proud of all you: your hustle. You inspired me.

If you're reading this and aren't in the j-school community, here's a few things our class can be proud of: 

<ul>
	<li>When a gas explosion caused a building collapse in Harlem, my classmates went to the scene and did stories.</li>
	<li>indian</li>
	<li>Some of the best photographers I've ever seen did out in the cold</li>
	<li>women in journalism</li>
	<li>free aj staff</li>
	<li>My interaction design class did some of my favorite online projects, ever.</li>
	<li>See plenty more of our work curated on <a href="http://www.columbiajournalist.org/">The Columbia Journalist</a>.</li>
</ul>

It's that determination, damnit that you're going to get that one last piece for the story, whether it's a source, shot, code for your data project or something else. It's that dedication — not the new ventures like Vox or FiveThirtyEight — that gives me hope for the future of journalism.

And I couldn't be prouder to be here together with you. At a time when most are running like hell away from journalism like it was a burning building, we decided to run in. Because that's what journalists do. I've been honored to call you classmates, and now, colleagues.

And thank God we did. Like any other time, our society needs journalism, and I suspect, now more than ever. Wars are going on, politicians have power and corporations influence the lives of people everyday. As a profession, we have a responsibility to give people the information they need to self-govern. To protect democracy. 

And there's a lot of new possibilities to do that. The potential opened up by the web, tech and data gives us the opportunity to do journalism that serves the purpose of democracy better than ever, and to think of new ways to do it. Journalism's first loyalty is to citizens, and we have to figure out how to get people reading, and to keep them doing so. Whichever country you come from, your readers need us to think innovatively, if we're to do our job right.

For those who are still interested in data and the intersection of tech and journalism: You can still learn. My biggest lesson in that area has been more reminder than anything: We can teach ourselves these things. And after meeting with the good nerds at ProPublica, WNYC, NICAR and The New York Times, I've found that's how they're doing it too. It's just means becoming better Googlers, and being patient with yourself as you learn. Besides, journalists are the best self-teachers — you do it every damn story. The best advice I got was to find something you wanted to know, and then learn the tech to do it. And of course, ask for help, probably before you need it. We're all in this together.

I came to j-school because I wanted to get the best education in journalism I could get. With the industry changing, I thought the traditional path of a grizzled editor teaching cub reporters would be difficult to find, and so decided to come to Columbia. I wasn't disappointed. I thought it was a mixed bag coming here right after undergrad — but now I couldn't be happier I did. For the last year, I've had the privilege of being around some of the most dedicated, intelligent and caring people I've ever met. I was surrounded by better reporters and journalists overall than me, whether students, professors or visitors to our school, and I consider myself extremely lucky to have had this. Now I know where to strive to, and whom I have the honor of doing it with.

We are forerunners for the next generation of journalism. And I couldn't be prouder to be here in it with you, Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Class of 2014.

All my love, and good luck out there.
