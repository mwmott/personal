After being exposed to the rising field of data journalism at Columbia, a group of students began practicing basic data techniques. While a lot of our time was put in to getting to know a beat and doing shoe-leather reporting, in the late Sunday and Monday nights, we were usually gathered together around a dataset.

I wanted to be able to visualize the city through the information data provided. So when we began looking at Common Core statistics, I was excited for what seemed to be a great application to do that.

We used an NYC Dep. of Edu. dataset, which was a messy .xls until Mark Hansen helped us clean it up to look like the above. We then added in school names and addresses to the pass rates, and created the following maps. 

Matt Collette gets the bulk of the credit for going through this work initially and then walking through with our class afterwards. But here are those maps!

Here's the big look at the city as a whole. l34p shows the score range (in passing percentage), and the size of the dot indicates how many of the tests were taken.
