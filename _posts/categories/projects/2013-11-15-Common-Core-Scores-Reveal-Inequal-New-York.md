After being exposed to the rising field of data journalism at Columbia, a group of students and I started practicing basic data techniques. While a lot of our time was doing shoe-leather reporting in our beats (mine was in the South Bronx), we were usually gathered together around a dataset on late Sunday or Monday nights.

When our group began looking at Common Core statistics, I was excited for what seemed to be a great application to visualize the city through data.

We used an NYC Dep. of Edu. dataset, which was a messy .xls until our teacher, Mark Hansen, helped us clean it up to look like the above. We then added in school names and addresses to the pass rates. Matt Collette gets the bulk of the credit for going through this work initially and then walking through with our class afterwards. We created the following maps:

Here's the big look at the city as a whole. l34p shows the score range (in passing percentage), and the size of the dot indicates how many of the tests were taken. And then here's the rest of the city through each of New York's five boroughs:

<div class="row">
<span class="span12" style="float:left;vertical-align:middle;">Manhattan has much cooler colors generally, with smaller schools.</span><span><img src="{{ base.url }}/assets/img/post/core3.jpg" alt="NYC Common Core-Manhattan" style="float:right" height="490"></span>
</div>

<hr />
<div class="row">
<span class="span12" style="float:left;vertical-align:middle;">When we get out to Brooklyn and the other outer boroughts, the dots tend to get larger and warmer, indicated lower test scores in larger schools.</span><span><img src="{{ base.url }}/assets/img/post/core4.jpg" alt="NYC Common Core-Brooklyn" style="float:right" height="490"/></span>
</div>

<hr />
<div class="row">
<span class="span12" style="float:left;vertical-align:middle;">Queens is mostly in the ~25% zone, except for Jackson Heights and Elmhurst. This might indicate a future lead to follow-up on later for an education story.</span><span><img src="{{ base.url }}/assets/img/post/core5.jpg" alt="NYC Common Core-Queens" style="float:right" height="490"/></span>
</div>

<hr />
<div class="row">
<span class="span12" style="float:left;vertical-align:middle;">Staten Island has fewer schools, with those there being larger than the average.</span><span><img src="{{ base.url }}/assets/img/post/core6.jpg" alt="NYC Common Core-Staten Island" style="float:right" height="490"/></span>
</div>

<hr />
<div class="row">
<span class="span12" style="float:left;vertical-align:middle;">And finally the Bronx, which shows a larger diversity in test scores trending toward the lower.</span><span><img src="{{ base.url }}/assets/img/post/core7.jpg" alt="NYC Common Core-Bronx" style="float:right" height="490"/></span>
